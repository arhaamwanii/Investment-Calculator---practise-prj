well well
    - the last thing you want is to fail in a subject in boards - truth being told - there is no chnace in hell i can afford to do that
    - so i will have to study a lot inorder to not fail in the boards

the vievers of this channel are rn the guys who so study with me kind of stuff so they are not remotely intreged by watching someone live
    - getting vievers and having a fuctional channel is not a main line of concern today
    - this is not going to make any differene so am better of without getting viervers
    - aiiming for viervers is not the main concern of this channel

even.target.value
    - we will always get a string 
    - even if the type of the string is set to be number
